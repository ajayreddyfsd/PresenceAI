# PresenceAI: Real-Time Public Speaking Analyzer

Effective communication is more than just words—it’s about how you present yourself physically. PresenceAI leverages advanced computer vision and AI techniques to track and evaluate your posture, hand gestures, and eye contact during live or recorded speeches. Using **MediaPipe**, the system accurately detects body and hand landmarks to assess posture and meaningful gestures. It employs **OpenCV** to process video input in real-time, whether from a live camera feed or a saved video. The collected metrics are then stored in **MongoDB** for analysis and historical tracking. By quantifying key non-verbal cues and integrating AI-generated feedback, PresenceAI acts as your personal coach to sharpen your delivery and captivate your audience. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers speakers to enhance confidence, engagement, and overall stage presence.
